# Dance as Language: a formal language analysis of one idiolect of cross step waltz,a revived Lead-Follow Social Dance. 
Note: This is a rough draft of a paper I hope to submit to dance research or some linguistics journal.
## Abstract
When the author says cross step waltz is a language, the author has to emphasis two easily accepted but large caveats. 
First, Cross Step Waltz is a lead-follow dance, and unsurprisingly the denotative semantic layer of this language 
is full of instructions to the other dancer on what to do.
For example, Cross Step Waltz can not denotate the statement "I am your brother".
Second, Cross Step Waltz is a living constructed language in that it will change and evolve over time 
but has heavy influence from particular designers and educators.
For context, there is now a textbook on the subject by richard powers.
The author's two methodological caveats capture that this is a theory paper.
First, this paper will be a formal language analysis based on the author's computer science background with advice given from friends.
Second, this paper will analyze the author's single idiolect with remarks on different idiolects.
Regardless of these caveats, this paper demonstrates that analyzing dance as language is useful.

NOTE TO SELF: talk about "dance is language", and "is dance language" papers. Search for more papers.
# Preliminaries:
The goal of this paper is both to convince linguists to take dance seriously,
and to compel dance researchers to go learn linguistics. 
In order to meet that goal, the author has taken a technique out of theoretical computer science 
and this preliminaries section will hopefully introduce the terms of one group to the other.
## Lead-Follow Social Dance:
### Line of Dance:
Travelling dances like cross step waltz travel around the dance floor while staying with your partner, the counterclockwise(if looking down at your feet) path around the dance floor is referred to as the line of dance. In some idiolects is a rectangle with corners, in my understanding it follows the same paths as any circular waltz mixer would on that floor.

# Model:
## The analogy:
Here is the overview of the analogy:
1. Sound - Position, Momentum, pressure of bodies
2. Accent - Style
3. Phonemes - Potential Positions and holds, pushes and pulls. Steps.
4. Morphemes - Nameable Embraces, orientations, and techniques.
5. Lexemes - Nameable moves
6. Syntatic Phrases - Arrangements of moves which are pleasant and easy to follow.
7. Semantic meaning - How to do the move, and some connotations including the musicality.
8. Conversational Dynamics - Skill and Style matching
9. Pragmatic Effects - Floorcraft
Because of the limited form of a 2-5 minute partner dance, there isn't a rhetoric level of dance.
## The Modality of lead-follow social partner dance:
Just like 4'3'' the abstract art piece by John Cage demonstrates 
that music is painted over time like a picasso is painted on a canvas, 
Dances unfold over time mostly through the medium of human bodies.
Lead-follow social partner dances have an extra medium not visible to onlookers: 
the pressure or lack thereof applied at points of contact.
### Open Question: Dances vs Signed languages
This modality is slightly different from signed languages, 
because those languages operate through the visibility of signs, 
whereas the dance discussed here is mostly signaled through pressure.
Regardless, It would be interesting to compare these two modalities, 
but I am currently underexperienced to do that.
## Accent - Style :
One way to discuss the accents of different dancers performing the same move
is to take derivatives of their movement with respect to time, and look at their qualia.
While two dancers might move through all the same reference points in relative space when performing the same move,
those two dancers might have categorically different derivatives.
The author's accent has been described in as smooth likely because I try to hit all the reference points 
while minimizing higher derivatives and making them continuous.
The accent of various competition dancers frequently has a very discontinuous 2nd derivative 
that almost feels like they hit their target points and bounce into a new direction.
The better competition dancers might still smoothly dance into that point (and mind the first derivative),
but if I was to track the path they take through the dance,
this author claims it would look piecewise linear instead of piecewise cubic or quartic.
### Hypothesis 1: 
Smoothness in dance experience can be analyzed as smoothness in position data.
### Hypothesis 2:
Competition dancers hit their intended reference points hard, rather than pass through them smoothly.
## Phonetics - Bucketing Physical Space:
We start by analyzing the dancers whole body location relative to the line of dance.
The first bucketing among areas of the dance floor :
1. travelling
2. not travelling 

These depend on where a couple preceive the slow lane of the line of dance to end, and the non-travelling area to begin.
The second bucketing of space is whether the lead is facing:
1. down line of dance
2. up line of dance
3. in towards the center
4. out towards the edge

The third bucketing is the relative position of the dancers: 
1. Roughly facing on another
2. Allemande left (facing in opposite directions with the other dancer to your rough left)
3. Allemande right
4. Follow on the lead's left.
5. Follow on the lead's right.



## Phonemes: 
# Answers:
The nature of social dance being a language full of instructions instead of facts implies to me the answer to the question 
```"why can't I dance the phrase: <<He is my brother>>?"``` The answer becomes obvious to me that denotation is lost, 
because the audience is frequently not fluent in the dance being performed 
and is rarely an active listener in the dance being performed.
Thus, the medium struggles to contain precise meaning.
Without time tight feedback, language can lose denotative meaning.
