# Lead-Follow Social Dance as Language: a formal language analysis of one idiolect of cross step waltz 
Note: This is a rough draft of a paper I hope to submit to dance research or some linguistics journal.
## Abstract
When the author says cross step waltz is a language, the author has to emphasis two easily accepted but large caveats. 
First, Cross Step Waltz is a lead-follow dance, and unsurprisingly the denotative semantic layer of this language 
is full of instructions to the other dancer on what to do.
For example, Cross Step Waltz can not denotate the statement "I am your brother".
Second, Cross Step Waltz is a living constructed language in that it will change and evolve over time 
but has heavy influence from particular designers and educators.
For context, there is now a textbook on the subject by richard powers.
The author's two methodological caveats capture that this is a theory paper.
First, this paper will be a formal language analysis based on the author's computer science background with advice given from friends.
Second, this paper will analyze a single idiolect with remarks on different idiolects.

NOTE TO SELF: talk about dance is language, and is dance language papers. Search for more papers.
# Preliminaries:
The goal of this paper is both to convince linguists to take dance seriously,
and to compel dance researchers to go learn linguistics. 
In order to meet that goal, the author has taken a technique out of theoretical computer science 
and this preliminaries section will hopefully introduce the terms of one group to the other.

# Model:
## The analogy:
1. Sound - Position and Momentum of bodies
2. Accent - Style
3. Phonemes - Potential Positions and holds, pushes and pulls. Steps.
4. Morphemes - Nameable Embraces, orientations, and techniques.
5. Lexemes - Nameable moves
6. Syntatic Phrases - Arrangements of moves which are pleasant and easy to follow.
7. Semantic meaning - How to do the move, and some connotations.
8. Pragmatic Effects - Floorcraft

# Answers:
The nature of social dance being a language full of instructions instead of facts implies to me the answer to the question 
```"why can't I dance the phrase: <<He is my brother>>?"``` The answer becomes obvious to me that denotation is lost, 
because the audience is frequently not fluent in the dance being performed 
and is rarely an active listener in the dance being performed.
Thus, the medium struggles to contain precise meaning.
Without time tight feedback, language can lose denotative meaning.
